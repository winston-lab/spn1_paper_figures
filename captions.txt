Figure 1: Spn1 depletion

a: Western blot showing levels of Spn1 protein in the Spn1 depletion strain after 90 minutes of treatment with DMSO (non-depleted) or 25 $\mu$M IAA (Spn1-depleted). Pgk1 is shown as a loading control. The values below the blots indicate the mean $\pm$ standard deviation of normalized Spn1 abundance quantified from two biological replicates.

b: Average Spn1 ChIP-seq enrichment over 3087 non-overlapping verified coding genes, in non-depleted and Spn1-depleted conditions. For each gene, the spike-in normalized ratio of IP over input signal is standardized to the mean and standard deviation of the non-depleted signal over the region, resulting in standard scores that allow genes with varied expression levels to be compared on the same scale. The solid line and shading are the median and interquartile range of the mean standard score over two replicates.

c: Total levels of Spn1 on chromatin in non-depleted and Spn1-depleted conditions, estimated from spike-in normalized Spn1 ChIP-seq IP and input library sizes (see Methods). The values and errorbars for each condition indicate the mean $\pm$ standard deviation of two replicates.

c: Uppermost panel: Average Rpb1 ChIP-seq enrichment in non-depleted and Spn1-depleted conditions, over 3087 non-overlapping verified coding genes. Standard scores are calculated as in Figure 1b. The solid line and shading are the median and interquartile range of the mean standard score over four replicates. Lowermost two panels: Average Rpb1-normalized Rpb1-Ser5P and Rpb1-Ser2P ChIP-seq enrichment in non-deleted and Spn1-depleted conditions, for the same genes. The solid line and shading are the median and interquartile range of the mean ratio over two replicates.

Supplemental 2:

a: Scatterplot comparing changes in transcript abundance upon Spn1 depletion as measured by RNA-seq and RT-qPCR. Errorbars indicate 95% confidence intervals.

b: RNA-seq coverage over four genes with antisense transcripts that are differentially expressed upon Spn1 depletion. Values are spike-in normalized, with sense and antisense strand signal plotted above and below the x-axis, respectively. Unlabeled horizontal lines indicate the boundaries of transcripts called by StringTie.

c: Total levels of Rpb1, Rpb1-Ser2P, and Rpb1-Ser5P on chromatin in non-depleted and Spn1-depleted conditions, estimated from spike-in normalized ChIP-seq IP and input library sizes (see Methods). The values and errorbars for each condition indicate the mean $\pm$ standard deviation of two replicates.


Figure 3: Promoter replacement

a: Schematic of \textit{YLR454} promoter replacement strains.

b: Scatterplot summarizing the results of the promoter replacement experiment. The y-axis shows RT-qPCR measurements of the change in \textit{YLR454} transcript abundance upon Spn1 depletion in the promoter replacement strains. The x-axis shows RNA-seq measurements of the change in transcript abundance upon Spn1 depletion for the native gene whose promoter was used to drive \textit{YLR454} expression in the promoter replacement strain. The errorbars indicate 95% confidence intervals, and points corresponding to the same native gene are slightly jittered along the x axis for clarity.


Figure 4: Spt6 and Set2

a: Representative western blots showing the results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments to analyze the effects of Spn1 or Spt6 depletion on the binding of Spn1, Spt6, and Set2 to Rpb3-FLAG. Spn1 or Spt6 depletion strains (Spn1-AID or Spt6-AID) were treated for 90 minutes with DMSO (lanes marked 'D') or 25 $\mu$M IAA (lanes marked 'I'), after which Rpb3-FLAG was immunoprecipitated and co-immunoprecipitation of Spn1, Spt6, and Set2 was assayed by western blots using native antibodies. Rpb3-FLAG levels were measured using $\alpha$-FLAG antibody, and an Rpb3-FLAG strain lacking the degron tag on Spn1 and Spt6 was included as an additional non-depleted control.

b: Average Spt6 ChIP-seq enrichment over 3087 non-overlapping verified coding genes, in non-depleted and Spn1-depleted conditions. Standard scores are calculated as in Figure 1b. The solid line and shading are the median and interquartile range of the mean standard score over two replicates.

c: Barplot showing total levels of Spt6 on chromatin in non-depleted and Spn1-depleted conditions, estimated from spike-in normalized Spt6 ChIP-seq IP and input library sizes (see Methods). The values and errorbars for each condition indicate the mean $\pm$ standard deviation of two replicates.

The solid line and shading are the median and interquartile range of the mean ratio over two replicates. Bottom: Heatmaps of the ChIP-seq enrichment ratio of histone modifications H3K36me3, H3K36me2, and H3K4me3 over H3 in non-depleted and Spn1-depleted conditions, for the same 3087 non-overlapping coding genes aligned by TSS and arranged by gene length. Values more extreme than the 10^{th} and 90^{th} percentiles are respectively set to the 10^{th} and 90^{th} percentiles for visualization.

Figure 6: splicing

a: Volcano plot showing changes in intron retention upon Spn1 depletion, for 252 non-mitochondrial introns not lying within the 5' UTR. Intron retention is defined for each intron as the proportion of unspliced transcripts, and was estimated from RNA-seq reads (see Methods). Labeled introns were further assayed by RT-qPCR, as shown in panel b.

b: RT-qPCR measurements of the ratio of unspliced to spliced transcripts in a wild-type strain treated with DMSO for 90 minutes, and a Spn1-AID degron strain treated with 25 $\mu$M IAA for 90 minutes. Errorbars indicate the mean $\pm$ standard deviation of two replicates.
